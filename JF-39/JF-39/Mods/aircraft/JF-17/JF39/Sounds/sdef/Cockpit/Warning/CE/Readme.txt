How to add customized voice-over:

1. Copy all sdef files from sdef/Cockpit/Warning/EN1/ to sdef/Cockpit/Warning/CE/ (same location of this Readme.txt)
   Note: sdef file names must NOT be changed!!
2. Add your own voice-over WAV files into Effects/CE/ folder
   Note: if you don't see CE folder, create one.
3. Your customized WAV file names must match those in corresponding sdef files, respectively
   Note: it's better to keep WAV file names case sensitive.
