The design phase of JF-17 'Thunder' finished on May 31st, 2002, and the maiden flight was made on August 25th, 2003. 'Thunder' has a bubble canopy of great view, pretty strake-wing layout and advanced avionics. KLJ-7 radar provides excellent air to ground capability. WMD-7 targeting pod can help 'Thunder' searching for targets in combat. Although 'Thunder' has small size, remember that: she is one of the most advanced fighter jets in the DCS World."),
