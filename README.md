# JAS-39C by Whisky Actual using JF-17 avionics
Welcome to the initial release of the JAS-39-C Mod using the JF-17 avionics! This is a personal project of mine based on the amazing work of the Community JAS-39-C Mod. Until we are able to achieve the standalone, this mod will satisfy all your 4th Gen fighter needs, with an advanced radar, TGP, EWS suit, and one of the best SA pages in the game. I've re-mapped our cockpit to match the JF-17's avionics. Fun fact, about 95% of the functions of the Jeff maps directly to the Gripen functions. Thus, if you already know one of these airframes you will feel at home. I will be making some videos to learn this "new" plane, so stay tuned!

- JF-39_Player.zip contains the cockpit, systems, and files needed to fly the JAS-39-C. This will replace the JF-17 cockpit.

## Installation Troubleshooting
If your game fails to launch maybe the mod is conflicting with another one. We suggest removing all of the mods found in C:\Users\username\Saved Games\DCS\Mods\. You can add your mods back one at a time and see which one conflicts.
